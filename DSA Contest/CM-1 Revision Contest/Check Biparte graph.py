Check Bipartite Graph
 Flag Question
Problem Description
Given a undirected graph having A nodes. A matrix B of size M x 2 is given which represents the edges such that there is an edge between B[i][0] and B[i][1].

Find whether the given graph is bipartite or not.

A graph is bipartite if we can split it's set of nodes into two independent subsets A and B such that every edge in the graph has one node in A and another node in B

Note:

There are no self-loops in the graph.

No multiple edges between two pair of vertices.

The graph may or may not be connected.

Nodes are Numbered from 0 to A-1.

Your solution will run on multiple testcases. If you are using global variables make sure to clear them.



Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 100000

1 <= M <= min(A*(A-1)/2,200000)

0 <= B[i][0],B[i][1] < A



Input Format
The first argument given is an integer A.

The second argument given is the matrix B.



Output Format
Return 1 if the given graph is bipartide else return 0.



Example Input
Input 1:

A = 2
B = [ [0, 1] ]
Input 2:

A = 3
B = [ [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2] ]


Example Output
Output 1:

1
Output 2:

0


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

Put 0 and 1 into 2 different subsets.
Explanation 2:

 
It is impossible to break the graph down to make two different subsets for bipartite matching
