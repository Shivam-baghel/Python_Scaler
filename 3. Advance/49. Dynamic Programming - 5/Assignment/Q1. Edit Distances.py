Q1. Edit Distance
Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of steps required to convert A to B. (each operation is counted as 1 step.)
You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character

Problem Constraints
1 <= length(A), length(B) <= 450

Input Format
The first argument of input contains a string, A.
The second argument of input contains a string, B.

Output Format
Return an integer, representing the minimum number of steps required.

Example Input
Input 1:
 A = "abad"
 B = "abac"
Input 2:
 A = "Anshuman"
 B = "Antihuman
 
Example Output
Output 1:
 1
Output 2:
 2

Example Explanation
Exlanation 1:
 A = "abad" and B = "abac"
 After applying operation: Replace d with c. We get A = B.
 
Explanation 2:
 A = "Anshuman" and B = "Antihuman"
 After applying operations: Replace s with t and insert i before h. We get A = B
