Q3. Valid Sudoku
Determine if a Sudoku is valid, according to: http://sudoku.com.au/TheRules.aspx
The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character '.'.

The input corresponding to the above configuration :

["53..7....", "6..195...", ".98....6.", "8...6...3", "4..8.3..1", "7...2...6", ".6....28.", "...419..5", "....8..79"]
A partially filled sudoku which is valid.

Note:
A valid Sudoku board (partially filled) is not necessarily solvable. Only the filled cells need to be validated.
Return 0 / 1 ( 0 for false, 1 for true ) for this problem

"""


"""
Steps:
Check duplicate value in column, if it is return 0, else continue
Check duplicate value in row, if it is return 0, else continue
Check duplicate value in 9x9 box, if it is return 0, else continue
